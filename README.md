# Logic-minization
This is a c++ program that converts SOP (sum of products) and POS (product of sum) forms to minterms and then uses **Quine Mccluskey** method to get minimized expression.
>Task 1 is a program that takes expressions as input and convert them into their equivalent minterms. It takes input.txt file as input in which all the expressions are written in the same format as of the sample file attached.

>Task 2 is a program that takes minterms as input and then find the essential prime implicants using Quine Mccluskey method. It takes output file of task 1 as input and generate a file with minimized logical expression of those minterms.
